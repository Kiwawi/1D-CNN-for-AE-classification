# 1D CNN for Heart Failure Classification using Acoustic Emission Signal

This project implements a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying lung sounds into normal and heart failure (HF) categories. The model is trained on segmented audio data from two Acoustic Emission channels (Channel A and Channel B) and demonstrates the use of deep learning in biomedical signal processing.
